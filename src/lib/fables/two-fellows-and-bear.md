TWO Fellows were travelling together through a wood, when a Bear rushed out upon them. One of the travellers happened to be in front, and he seized hold of the branch of a tree, and hid himself among the leaves. The other, seeing no help for it, threw himself flat down upon the ground, with his face in the dust. The Bear, coming up to him, put his muzzle close to his ear, and sniffed and sniffed. But at last with a growl he shook his head and slouched off, for bears will not touch dead meat. Then the fellow in the tree came down to his comrade, and, laughing, said “What was it that Master Bruin whispered to you?”

“He told me,” said the other,

“NEVER TRUST A FRIEND WHO DESERTS YOU AT A PINCH.”

### Interpretations and Insights:

"The Two Fellows and the Bear" provides a direct message about loyalty and courage, embodied in the saying "NEVER TRUST A FRIEND WHO DESERTS YOU AT A PINCH." However, it is also teeming with other subtle and non-obvious lessons and insights.

The fundamental lesson from this fable is the importance of true friendship. A real friend is someone who sticks with you during times of danger or trouble, not someone who abandons you in fear.

### Hidden Insights:

1. **Pragmatism and Presence of Mind**: The fable points out the importance of pragmatism and presence of mind. The second traveler shows quick thinking by playing dead, which ultimately saves his life.

2. **Survival Instincts**: This story illustrates the value of understanding nature and its creatures for survival. The second traveler knows that bears won't touch dead meat, and he uses this knowledge to his advantage.

3. **Valor vs. Cowardice**: The contrasting reactions of the two fellows during the face of danger draw a clear line between valor and cowardice.

4. **False Comradeship**: It also highlights the issue of false comradeship. The first traveler, despite being in a position to help, chooses self-preservation and leaves his companion to face the danger alone.

5. **Teachable Moment**: The second traveler uses the incident as a teachable moment. Instead of showing resentment, he delivers a wise lesson about the nature of trust and friendship.

6. **Mockery and Humiliation**: The first traveler's laughter and the question he asks after the bear leaves further underscores his lack of empathy and companionship.

### Subtle Details:

The bear's behavior is interestingly human-like, as it "shakes its head" and "slouches off," which subtly provides it a role of an unwitting teacher in the story. The first traveler's question, while seemingly jesting, ends up being the setup for the second traveler's profound statement, again subtly guiding the narrative towards the moral of the story.

### Additional Interpretations and Insights:

1. **Emotional Intelligence**: The second traveler's calm response to his companion's mockery shows emotional intelligence. Instead of lashing out in anger, he replies with wisdom, showing an ability to manage emotions even in difficult situations.

2. **Nature as an Unexpected Teacher**: Nature, represented by the bear, can be an unexpected source of wisdom. The situation with the bear, besides testing the travelers' friendship, provides a lesson on trust and loyalty.

3. **Value of Knowledge**: The second traveler's knowledge about bears not touching dead meat, and his application of it in a critical situation, highlights the value of knowledge and its appropriate use.
