A LION had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death at the mouth of his cave, gasping for breath. The animals, his subjects, came round him and drew nearer as he grew more and more helpless. When they saw him on the point of death they thought to themselves: “Now is the time to pay off old grudges.” So the Boar came up and drove at him with his tusks; then a Bull gored him with his horns; still the Lion lay helpless before them: so the Ass, feeling quite safe from danger, came up, and turning his tail to the Lion kicked up his heels into his face. “This is a double death,” growled the Lion.

“ONLY COWARDS INSULT DYING MAJESTY.”

### Interpretations and Insights:

The fable tells a story about a dying lion who is attacked by the animals he once ruled. This story imparts lessons about respect, bravery, and the nature of power.

1. **Respect Should Be Maintained, Even in Weakness**: The primary lesson is in the Lion's final words—"Only cowards insult dying majesty". The animals attack the lion only when he is on the brink of death, incapable of defending himself. This cowardly act emphasizes that respect should be given regardless of someone's current state, and it is dishonorable to attack someone who cannot fight back.

2. **The Nature of Power and Fear**: When the Lion was strong and in power, the other animals feared him. However, when he became weak, the animals saw it as an opportunity to attack. This underscores the often transient and fragile nature of power, especially when it's based on fear rather than respect or admiration.

### Hidden Insights:

1. **The Reciprocity of Actions**: The story suggests that the Lion might have ruled in a way that caused resentment among the animals, leading them to seize the opportunity to get their revenge when he was at his weakest. This suggests the concept of reciprocity - actions in the present can have repercussions in the future.

2. **The Varying Degrees of Revenge**: It's noteworthy how each animal attacks the lion. The Boar and the Bull, stronger animals, directly attack with their tusks and horns. However, the Ass, traditionally seen as a weaker, less brave creature, waits until the lion is utterly helpless before kicking him. This can be interpreted as a commentary on how individuals (or animals, in this case) choose their battles based on their strengths and perceived risks.

3. **Cowardice vs Bravery**: The Ass only dared to attack the Lion when it was certain there was no risk, underscoring the Lion's comment about cowardice. The fable suggests that bravery isn't about taking advantage when an adversary is weak, but having the courage to face them when they're at full strength.

4. **The Dignity in Death and Weakness**: The Lion's remark about a "double death" can be interpreted as an insight into dignity in death and during times of weakness. Not only is he physically dying, but the disrespect from his subjects feels like a second, metaphorical death. This might hint at the importance of maintaining dignity and respect even in the face of someone's death or downfall.

5. **A Reflection on Leadership and Rule**: On a deeper level, the story may serve as a critique of the Lion's rule. The fact that the other animals are eager to take revenge might suggest that his reign was characterized by fear and oppression. This could be a reminder that leadership should be grounded in mutual respect and fairness, rather than intimidation or tyranny.

### Additional Interpretations and Insights:

1. **Paying Off Old Grudges**: The animals use the Lion's weakness as an opportunity to settle old scores, indicating how resentment can linger and manifest when the power dynamic changes. It emphasizes the importance of treating others justly, as past actions can come back to haunt us in our weakest moments.

2. **Behavior In Moments of Superiority**: The Ass, feeling safe from danger, disrespectfully kicks the Lion. This displays how some individuals might misuse the power they get from others' weakness. It points to the necessity of respectful and dignified behavior, even when we have the upper hand.

3. **The True Measure of Character**: The animals reveal their true character, not when the Lion was strong, but when he was weak. It highlights the idea that how one treats those who can do nothing for them is a true measure of their character.
