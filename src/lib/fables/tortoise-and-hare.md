Once upon a time, there was a tortoise and a hare. The hare was very proud of his speed and often made fun of the tortoise, who was slow and steady.

One day, the tortoise, tired of the hare's boasting, challenged him to a race. The hare, confident in his speed, accepted the challenge, thinking it was an easy win. The race began, and the hare quickly pulled ahead, leaving the tortoise far behind.

Confident in his lead, the hare decided to take a nap midway and fell asleep. The tortoise, despite being slow, kept going at his steady pace. He overtook the sleeping hare and crossed the finish line, winning the race.

When the hare woke up, he was shocked to see the tortoise had won. He realized that speed alone was not enough to ensure victory and that being consistent and steady was just as important.
