A WOLF had been gorging on an animal he had killed, when suddenly a small bone in the meat stuck in his throat and he could not swallow it. He soon felt terrible pain in his throat, and he ran up and down groaning and groaning and seeking for something to relieve the pain. He tried to induce every one he met to remove the bone. “I would give anything,” said he, “if you would take it out.” At last the Crane agreed to try, and told the Wolf to lie on his side and open his jaws as wide as he could. Then the Crane put its long neck down the Wolf’s throat, and with its beak loosened the bone, till at last got it out.

“Will you kindly give me the reward you promised?” said the Crane.

The Wolf grinned and showed his teeth and said: “Be content. You have put your head inside a Wolf’s mouth and taken it out again in safety; that ought to be reward enough for you.”

“GRATITUDE AND GREED GO NOT TOGETHER.”

### Interpretations and Insights:

1. **Immediate Gratification Can Lead to Trouble**: The wolf, gorging on his prey without taking the time to properly chew and eat, ended up with a bone stuck in his throat. This could serve as a metaphor for impulsive behavior or the desire for immediate gratification without considering the possible consequences.

2. **Desperation Can Lead to Promises**: In his pain and fear, the wolf promises anything to anyone who can help him. This teaches that desperation can lead people to make promises they might not normally make or even intend to keep. It's a cautionary note to be wary of promises made in desperation or under duress.

3. **Courage and Risk-taking**: The crane shows great courage in agreeing to remove the bone from the wolf's throat. This act of bravery also suggests that taking risks can be necessary to achieve something or help someone in need.

4. **Exploitation and Ingratitude**: After the crane successfully removes the bone, the wolf doesn't honor his promise of a reward. Instead, he shows his teeth (a threat) and says the crane should be satisfied it wasn't eaten. This behavior illustrates the character's ingratitude and willingness to exploit others' kindness for personal gain. The wolf uses his physical superiority and intimidating nature to deny the crane its due reward.

5. **The Fickleness of Power**: The wolf, who was in pain and helpless at the beginning of the story, regains his power after the bone is removed. However, he misuses this power to deny the crane its reward, showing how power dynamics can quickly shift and be exploited.

6. **The Underlying Theme - "Gratitude and Greed Go Not Together"**: The final line of the fable neatly summarizes its central message. The wolf's greed prevents him from being grateful to the crane who saved him, which further exposes his selfish and ungrateful nature.

Hidden Insights:

1. **Risk and Reward**: The crane's experience can be seen as a commentary on the uncertainties involved in risk-taking. While the crane was heroic and was promised a reward, it ended up getting nothing. This can be a cautionary note about ensuring guarantees before taking a risk, especially when dealing with unreliable parties.

2. **Need vs Greed**: When the wolf was in need, he was ready to promise anything. But when his need was satisfied, his greed took over. This suggests a dichotomy between need and greed that can lead individuals to act differently under different circumstances.

3. **Disparity in Power Dynamics**: This tale also provides a lesson about power dynamics and how they can be misused. The wolf, being physically superior, is able to exploit the crane and deny it its due reward. This points to a societal issue where those in power sometimes exploit those who are weaker or more vulnerable.
