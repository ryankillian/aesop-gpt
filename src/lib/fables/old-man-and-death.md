AN OLD labourer, bent double with age and toil, was gathering sticks in a forest. At last he grew so tired and hopeless that he threw down the bundle of sticks, and cried out: “I cannot bear this life any longer. Ah, I wish Death would only come and take me!”

As he spoke, Death, a grisly skeleton, appeared and said to him: “What wouldst thou, Mortal? I heard thee call me.”

“Please, sir,” replied the woodcutter, “would you kindly help me to lift this bundle of sticks on to my shoulder?”

“WE WOULD OFTEN BE SORRY IF OUR WISHES WERE GRATIFIED.”

### Interpretations and Insights:

"The Old Man and Death" is a poignant fable that encapsulates the themes of life's struggles, the human condition, fear of death, and the nature of wishes.

1. **The Reality of Hardship and Struggle**: The old laborer's hardship underscores life's struggles and the weight of aging. The toil symbolizes the burdens and struggles we all bear, reminding us that everyone has their load of hardships, and sometimes, these hardships can become overwhelming.

2. **The Human Condition**: The old man's exhaustion and subsequent plea for death mirror the human tendency to seek relief from persistent struggles, even to the point of contemplating death. It's a stark portrayal of the human condition in its most vulnerable state.

3. **Reconsidering Our Wishes**: When faced with the actual appearance of Death, the laborer refrains from his earlier plea for death, instead asking for help with his burden. This shift shows how, under dire circumstances, people might wish for things without fully realizing the implications. When confronted with the potential reality of our wishes, we may realize they are not what we truly want.

4. **The Irony of Desperation**: The irony lies in the old man's initial plea for Death and his subsequent request. He originally views Death as a means of escape from his hardships but ends up asking Death for help with his work. This turnaround encapsulates the paradox of human desperation – seeking escape while still trying to cope with difficulties.

5. **Fear and Acceptance of Death**: The old man's request for help, rather than following through on his initial wish, reflects the common fear of death. Even in difficult situations, the instinct for survival often prevails. Death, usually seen as a figure of fear and finality, is depicted as a natural part of life's cycle.

6. **Wisdom in the Proverb**: The concluding proverb, "WE WOULD OFTEN BE SORRY IF OUR WISHES WERE GRATIFIED.", underscores the story's message about the nature of our desires. It serves as a cautionary reminder to think carefully about our wishes, as their fulfillment might not bring the relief or happiness we imagine.

### Additional Interpretations and Insights:

1. **Perception of Death**: In the story, Death isn't portrayed as evil but rather as a natural part of life's cycle. When Death appears in response to the old man's plea, it doesn't bring fear or harm but simply asks how it can serve him. This portrayal can encourage us to see death not as a terrifying end but as a natural part of existence.

2. **Resilience in Hardship**: Even after expressing his exhaustion and desire for death, the old man continues his task, asking Death to help him lift his burden. This can be seen as a testament to human resilience. Even when burdened with immense hardship, there is a part of us that continues to strive and survive.

In conclusion, "The Old Man and Death" is a complex narrative that addresses the realities of life's struggles, the nature of human desperation, the reconsideration of hastily made wishes, the human fear and acceptance of death, and the wisdom in being careful with our desires.
