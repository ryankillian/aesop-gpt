A FISHER once took his bagpipes to the bank of a river, and played upon them with the hope of making the fish rise; but never a one put his nose out of the water. So he cast his net into the river and soon drew it forth filled with fish. Then he took his bagpipes again, and, as he played, the fish leapt up in the net. “Ah, you dance now when I play,” said he.

“Yes,” said an old Fish:

“WHEN YOU ARE IN A MAN’S POWER YOU MUST DO AS HE BIDS YOU.”

### Interpretations and Insights:

"The Fisher" is a fable that explores themes of power, control, manipulation, and the dynamics of freedom and coercion.

The immediate lesson from this fable is that those in positions of power can dictate the actions of others. The fish do not respond to the fisher's music until they are captured, demonstrating that they are now compelled to follow his whims.

### Hidden Insights:

1. **Ineffectiveness of Persuasion without Leverage**: Initially, the fisher tries to lure the fish with his music, but it doesn't work. It's only when he uses his net, i.e., he gains control over them, that he can make the fish "dance". This may point to the ineffectiveness of persuasion without any form of leverage.

2. **Illusion of Response**: When the fisher plays his bagpipes and the captured fish leap, it might seem to an onlooker that the fish are responding to the music. However, we know that the fish are not dancing for joy; they are trapped. This highlights the importance of understanding context in any situation.

3. **Power Dynamics**: The old fish's comment underscores the power dynamics at play, highlighting the harsh reality of being in a weaker position. Those with less power often find themselves bending to the will of those who hold power over them.

4. **Misinterpretation of Actions**: The fisher's comment, "Ah, you dance now when I play," indicates a misunderstanding of why the fish are "dancing". This reflects the potential for misinterpretation when one does not fully comprehend the situation.

5. **Coercion vs. Free Will**: The fish "dance" in the net not out of desire or choice but due to the circumstances they are in. This can be seen as a reflection on the contrast between actions made under coercion and those made of free will.

6. **Mockery of Ignorance**: The old fish's comment can also be interpreted as a sarcastic remark aimed at the fisher's ignorance. Despite the fisher's belief that he's making the fish dance, the old fish subtly points out that the fisher's thinking is misguided.

Additional Interpretations and Insights:

1. **Understanding of Reality**: The fisher's misunderstanding of the fish's behavior could be indicative of a wider issue where those in power misunderstand the actions or motivations of those beneath them. It suggests a lack of understanding or empathy toward those in a weaker position.

2. **Manipulation of Perception**: The fisher's comment might suggest how individuals or entities in power can manipulate the perception of a situation to fit their narrative. By declaring the fish are dancing to his music, the fisher gives a misleading impression of his control over them.

3. **Insight into Injustice**: The speaking fish may be interpreted as giving a voice to the oppressed, making a strong statement about the dynamics between the powerful and the powerless. Its words provide insight into the feeling of injustice experienced by those who are forced to dance to someone else's tune.

### Subtle Details:

The choice of the instrument, a bagpipe, could be indicative of a certain cultural setting where bagpipes are common. The fisher seems to believe in the power of music, showing a kind of naive optimism or creativity. However, his understanding of the situation changes as he observes the trapped fish, suggesting that his original belief was misplaced.

It's the "old fish" that speaks the moral, implying wisdom that comes with age and experience. The choice of this fish to deliver the moral may be a subtle reminder of the respect often accorded to the wisdom of the aged or experienced.
