A LION used to prowl about a field in which Four Oxen used to dwell. Many a time he tried to attack them; but whenever he came near they turned their tails to one another, so that whichever way he approached them he was met by the horns of one of them. At last, however, they fell a-quarrelling among themselves, and each went off to pasture alone in a separate corner of the field. Then the Lion attacked them one by one and soon made an end of all four.

“UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL.”

### Interpretations and Insights:

This fable, "The Four Oxen and the Lion", provides various layers of lessons and insights related to unity, collaboration, vulnerability, and the strength of collective defense.

Here are several lessons, insights, and subtle details:

1. **Power of Unity**: The main theme of this fable is the importance of unity. Initially, the oxen were able to defend themselves from the lion by staying together, demonstrating that there is safety and strength in numbers.

2. **Collective Defense**: The way the oxen positioned themselves in a circle, with their tails inward and their horns outward, illustrates the concept of collective defense. This strategic arrangement ensured that the lion would always be met with resistance, no matter the direction of his approach.

3. **Disruption of Unity**: The quarrel among the oxen led to their separation, demonstrating how internal conflicts can undermine collective strength and unity. The lion, previously deterred by their unity, found the opportunity to attack when they were isolated.

4. **Exploitation of Disunity**: The lion's strategy reveals an insight about opportunistic behavior. The lion took advantage of the oxen's disunity to attack them one by one, indicating that division can make individuals or groups vulnerable to external threats.

5. **Irreversible Consequences of Division**: The phrase "soon made an end of all four" underscores the severity and irreversible nature of the consequences when unity is broken. It suggests the drastic shift in the balance of power that can occur when unity is lost.

6. **Importance of Reconciliation**: A subtle lesson is the importance of resolving disagreements to maintain unity. If the oxen had found a way to settle their differences and remain united, they could have continued to defend themselves against the lion.

7. **Implications of Isolation**: The oxen's decision to each pasture alone in a separate corner of the field emphasizes the vulnerability that comes with isolation. It further illustrates the idea that strength lies in unity, not in solitary action, no matter how strong an individual may be.

8. **Manipulation of Circumstances**: The lion's actions showcase an element of strategic patience and manipulation of circumstances. It waited for the right moment when the oxen were divided, indicating that adversaries can patiently wait for vulnerabilities to surface.

### Additional Interpretations and Insights:

1. **Conflict Resolution**: This fable underscores the importance of conflict resolution. The oxen failed to resolve their internal differences, which led to their separation and ultimate demise. It highlights that differences should be handled effectively to maintain unity.

2. **Awareness of Threat**: The fable subtly points out the need for awareness of external threats. The oxen, while in conflict with each other, seem to forget the presence of the lion. This suggests that one must always be conscious of external threats, especially during internal conflicts.

3. **Strategic Planning**: The initial position of the oxen indicates the value of strategic planning. By positioning their horns outwards, they effectively deter the lion. This depicts that a well-thought-out strategy can provide a solid defense against potential threats.

The proverb at the end, "United we stand, divided we fall," encapsulates the moral of the story, reminding readers of the importance of unity and the dangers of division.
