A DOG looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the Manger of an Ox and lay there cosily upon the straw. But soon the Ox, returning from its afternoon work, came up to the Manger and wanted to eat some of the straw. The Dog in a rage, being awakened from its slumber, stood up and barked at the Ox, and whenever it came near attempted to bite it. At last the Ox had to give up the hope of getting at the straw, and went away muttering:

“AH, PEOPLE OFTEN GRUDGE OTHERS WHAT THEY CANNOT ENJOY THEMSELVES.”

### Interpretations and Insights:

"The Dog in the Manger" illustrates the principle of begrudging others the use of what one cannot use or does not need oneself.

The most evident lesson from this fable is the criticism of selfishness and ungenerous behavior. It highlights the unfairness of denying others access to resources that we ourselves cannot use or benefit from, a behavior embodied by the dog who cannot eat the straw but prevents the ox from doing so.

### Hidden Insights:

1. **The Misuse of Power**: The dog uses its capacity to intimidate to deny the ox what it needs. This behavior mirrors situations where individuals or entities wield their power not for constructive purposes, but to deny others access to resources or opportunities.

2. **Short-Sightedness**: The dog, preoccupied with its immediate comfort, does not consider the broader implications of its actions. It fails to foresee potential ramifications such as damaging its relationship with the ox or prompting retaliation.

3. **Inconsideration**: The dog's lack of empathy towards the ox, who just wants to eat after a long day of work, highlights the selfishness that comes with disregarding the needs and rights of others.

### Additional Interpretations and Insights:

1. **Disturbance of Peace**: The dog's actions not only affect the ox's ability to eat, but also disrupt the peaceful environment of the manger. This might suggest that selfish behavior often causes unrest and discomfort to others.

2. **Entitlement**: The dog's behavior could also be interpreted as a form of entitlement, believing it has the right to the manger despite the ox's need. This can be seen as a caution against presuming ownership or control over shared or public resources.

### Subtle Details:

The fable seems to point out an irony in the dog's behavior. As a domestic animal known for its loyalty and helpfulness to man, the dog in this case does not display these virtues. Instead, it displays selfishness, one of the traits dogs are least associated with, subtly reminding us that any being, regardless of their typical nature, can fall into the trap of selfishness.

The concluding statement, “Ah, people often grudge others what they cannot enjoy themselves,” is a powerful remark, encapsulating the fable's essence, and reminding readers that such a mindset—unfortunately found in "people"—is both selfish and counterproductive.
