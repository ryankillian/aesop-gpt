Once upon a time, there was a shepherd boy who was bored as he sat on the hillside watching the village sheep. To amuse himself he took a great breath and sang out, "Wolf! Wolf! The Wolf is chasing the sheep!"

The villagers came running up the hill to help the boy drive the wolf away. But when they arrived at the top of the hill, they found no wolf. The boy laughed at the sight of their angry faces.

"Didn't you see the wolf?" someone asked. The boy replied with a grin, "I was only playing a trick on you. There is no wolf."

The villagers were very angry with him for being so naughty. Then one day, a wolf really did come. The boy cried out, "Wolf! Wolf! There is a wolf!" But the villagers didn't come to help, thinking it was just another trick. In the end, the boy learned a valuable lesson about the consequences of lying.
