A LABOURER lay listening to a Nightingale’s song throughout the summer night. So pleased was he with it that the next night he set a trap for it and captured it. “Now that I have caught thee,” he cried, “though shalt always sing to me.”

“We Nightingales never sing in a cage,” said the bird.

“Then I’ll eat thee,” said the Labourer. “I have always heard say that nightingale on toast is a dainty morsel.”

“Nay, kill me not,” said the Nightingale; “but let me free, and I’ll tell thee three things far better worth than my poor body.” The Labourer let him loose, and he flew up to a branch of a tree and said: “Never believe a captive’s promise; that’s one thing. Then again: Keep what you have. And third piece of advice is: Sorrow not over what is lost forever.” Then the song-bird flew away.

### Interpretations and Insights:

"The Labourer and the Nightingale" is a complex fable that deals with themes of freedom, deceit, wisdom, and the fleeting nature of beauty and joy.

1. **Respecting Freedom and Natural Habits**: The labourer tries to cage the nightingale to hear its song, but the bird insists that it cannot sing in a cage. This illustrates the point that freedom is essential to natural behaviour and expression. One cannot force joy, creativity, or beauty; they manifest naturally under the right conditions.

2. **Beware of Deceit**: When the nightingale is captured, it resorts to trickery to secure its release. The labourer, in his greed and ignorance, falls for the bird's words. This serves as a reminder to be wary of false promises, particularly when they come from a position of desperation or captivity.

3. **Value What You Have**: The nightingale's second piece of advice - to keep what you have - speaks to the importance of appreciating and preserving what's already in one's possession. This can be seen as a caution against greed and the relentless pursuit of more.

4. **Accepting Loss**: The final wisdom offered by the bird - not to sorrow over what's lost forever - is a timeless lesson in acceptance and letting go. It suggests that sometimes, we need to accept losses as irreversible and move forward, rather than dwelling on the past.

5. **False Wisdom**: It's interesting to note that all the advice given by the nightingale pertains to its own situation and aims to benefit itself more than the labourer. This suggests a critique of false wisdom or advice that's designed to serve the adviser's own interests.

6. **Fleeting Beauty**: A more subtle theme in the fable is the fleeting nature of beauty and joy, represented by the nightingale's song. The labourer seeks to make it permanent by capturing the bird, but he ultimately learns that some experiences are transitory and cannot be possessed.

7. **Manipulation**: The nightingale cleverly manipulates the labourer into releasing it, demonstrating how intelligence can sometimes triumph over brute force or power.

### Additional Interpretations and Insights:

1. **Desire vs Need**: The labourer's desire to have the Nightingale sing for him always was an unnecessary luxury, not a need. His dissatisfaction with merely listening to the Nightingale without possessing it reveals human tendencies to desire more than what is required.

2. **The Power of Persuasion**: The Nightingale's ability to persuade the Labourer to free it shows the power of persuasive language. It serves to remind us that power doesn't only reside in physical strength but also in effective communication.

In conclusion, "The Labourer and the Nightingale" is a richly layered fable that offers valuable insights into human behaviour, the nature of wisdom, the importance of freedom, and the transient nature of beauty. It cautions against deceit, greed, and the inability to accept loss, serving as a timeless reminder of these universal truths.
