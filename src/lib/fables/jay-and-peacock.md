A JAY venturing into a yard where Peacocks used to walk, found there a number of feathers which had fallen from the Peacocks when they were moulting. He tied them all to his tail and strutted down towards the Peacocks. When he came near them they soon discovered the cheat, and striding up to him pecked at him and plucked away his borrowed plumes. So the Jay could do no better than go back to the other Jays, who had watched his behaviour from a distance; but they were equally annoyed with him, and told him:

“IT IS NOT ONLY FINE FEATHERS THAT MAKE FINE BIRDS.”

### Interpretations and Insights:

"The Jay and the Peacock" is a fable about authenticity, pretension, and the significance of inherent qualities over superficial appearances.

1. **Authenticity Over Pretension**: The main lesson of the fable, illustrated in the closing proverb, is the value of being genuine. The Jay tries to impress the Peacocks by wearing their feathers, but his pretentiousness is quickly exposed, leading to his disgrace. This implies that pretending to be someone or something you're not often leads to embarrassment and disrespect.

### Hidden Insights:

1. **Identity and Self-Esteem**: The fable indirectly discusses issues of identity and self-esteem. The Jay, dissatisfied with his own appearance, adopts the feathers of the Peacocks to elevate his status. This implies a lack of self-acceptance, which is a key factor in self-esteem and personal development.

2. **The Importance of Inner Qualities**: The story hints that appearance alone doesn't define the worth of an individual. The Peacocks reject the Jay not because of his looks, but because he tried to deceive them, suggesting that qualities such as honesty, integrity, and authenticity are more important than outward appearances.

3. **Social Consequences of Deception**: The Jay experiences social consequences for his deception. Not only is he rejected by the Peacocks, but he also loses the respect of his own kind. This highlights that dishonest actions can impact one's social standing and relationships.

4. **Dangers of Overambition**: The Jay's overambitious endeavor to transform his status is doomed from the start because it's based on a falsehood. It subtly teaches the reader that while ambition is generally good, it should be based on one's own abilities and authenticity rather than imitating others.

### Additional Interpretations and Insights:

1. **Self-Delusion**: The fable may also be interpreted as a commentary on self-delusion. The Jay deceives not only others but also himself, believing he can transform into a Peacock merely by borrowing their feathers. This leads to his humiliation, suggesting that self-deception can be as detrimental as deceiving others.

2. **Humility**: The story implicitly advocates for humility. The Jay's attempt to appear superior backfires, suggesting that humility and acceptance of one's own identity are preferable to pride and pretense.

3. **Individuality**: The fable subtly emphasizes the importance of individuality. By trying to imitate the Peacocks, the Jay loses his unique identity as a Jay. This can be seen as a reminder to value and maintain our distinctiveness rather than seeking to imitate others.

4. **Misunderstanding of Success**: The Jay misunderstands what makes the Peacocks successful and respected. He assumes it is merely their physical appearance, failing to understand that it's a combination of their inherent qualities and characteristics. The story hence serves as a critique of a simplistic understanding of success.

In summary, "The Jay and the Peacock" underscores the value of authenticity, self-acceptance, and the significance of inner qualities over appearances. It also discusses the social consequences of deception and warns against the dangers of overambitious endeavors based on false premises.
