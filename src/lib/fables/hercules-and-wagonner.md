A WAGGONER was once driving a heavy load along a very muddy way. At last he came to a part of the road where the wheels sank half-way into the mire, and the more the horses pulled, the deeper sank the wheels. So the Waggoner threw down his whip, and knelt down and prayed to Hercules the Strong. “O Hercules, help me in this my hour of distress,” quoth he. But Hercules appeared to him, and said:

“Tut, man, don’t sprawl there. Get up and put your shoulder to the wheel.”

“THE GODS HELP THEM THAT HELP THEMSELVES.”

### Interpretations and Insights:

"The Hercules and the Waggoner" is a fable that encapsulates valuable insights about self-reliance, the role of divine intervention, and the importance of effort.

1. **Self-Reliance**: The most obvious lesson of this fable is the importance of self-reliance and initiative. The Waggoner appeals to Hercules for help when his cart is stuck, but Hercules' response indicates that divine help alone isn't enough - effort from the individual in question is required.

2. **Effort before Aid**: This fable suggests that one should attempt to solve their problems through their own efforts before seeking help. The Waggoner does not first try to get his cart unstuck himself; instead, he immediately prays to Hercules. This can be taken as a lesson to always exhaust personal efforts before relying on external aid.

3. **Misplaced Faith**: The fable subtly critiques the Waggoner's immediate reliance on divine intervention. The Waggoner's expectation that Hercules will solve his problem for him suggests a misplaced faith in the power of the gods to fix earthly problems without any human effort.

4. **Perception of Divinity**: The fable provides an insight into how divinity may operate. The gods, in this case, Hercules, are not meant to eliminate our struggles, but to provide us the strength to overcome them ourselves.

5. **Responsibility**: The phrase "put your shoulder to the wheel" implies the value of taking responsibility for one's predicament. It is a call to action, urging the Waggoner to invest personal effort and face the situation rather than relying entirely on external help.

6. **Persistence**: Implicit in Hercules' advice is the virtue of persistence. Despite the difficulty of the situation, the Waggoner is encouraged not to give up but to persist in his efforts.

7. **Practicality Over Passivity**: Hercules' advice emphasizes the need for practical action over passive hope or prayer. It indicates that, while prayers might offer emotional comfort or guidance, it is our actions that ultimately bring about change.

### Additional Interpretations and Insights:

1. **The Role of Effort in Success**: The fable also provides a commentary on the role of effort in success. It implies that success is not handed to us on a silver platter but has to be earned through hard work and personal effort. The divine intervention may provide guidance or strength, but the actual task must be accomplished by the person.

2. **Active vs Passive Faith**: There's a distinction made between active and passive faith. Passive faith expects divine intervention to solve all problems without effort, while active faith understands that divine help is a supplement to personal effort. The Waggoner displays passive faith, and Hercules advises him towards active faith.

3. **Human-Deity Relationship**: The fable gives an insight into the perceived relationship between humans and deities. The deities don't serve humans, but they guide and inspire humans to act and help themselves.

In summary, "Hercules and the Waggoner" teaches the importance of self-reliance, personal effort, and taking responsibility for one's circumstances. It suggests that divine aid supplements, but does not replace, human effort. The fable subtly addresses the perception of divinity, the importance of persistence, and the value of practical action over passive hope.
