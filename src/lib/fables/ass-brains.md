THE LION and the Fox went hunting together. The Lion, on the advice of the Fox, sent a message to the Ass, proposing to make an alliance between their two families. The Ass came to the place of meeting, overjoyed at the prospect of a royal alliance. But when he came there the Lion simply pounced on the Ass, and said to the Fox: “Here is our dinner for today. Watch you here while I go and have a nap. Woe betide you if you touch my prey.” The Lion went away and the Fox waited; but finding that his master did not return, ventured to take out the brains of the Ass and ate them up. When the Lion came back he soon noticed the absence of the brains, and asked the Fox in a terrible voice: “What have you done with the brains?”

“Brains, your Majesty! it had none, or it would never have fallen into your trap.”

“WIT HAS ALWAYS AN ANSWER READY.”

### Interpretations and Insights:

"The Ass’s Brains" is a fable that imparts several valuable lessons about cleverness, opportunism, deceit, and the pitfalls of naivety.

1. **Main Lesson - Cleverness and Resourcefulness**: The adage, "WIT HAS ALWAYS AN ANSWER READY," is the central lesson of the fable. The Fox, by blaming the Ass's alleged lack of brains for its downfall, manages to shift the Lion's attention away from its own actions. This demonstrates the value of quick thinking and resourcefulness, especially in situations that might lead to undesirable consequences.

2. **Insight into Deception and Opportunism**: The Fox's action of eating the Ass's brains while the Lion is away shows opportunistic behavior. It seizes the chance when the Lion, who is mightier, is absent, showing that even in hierarchical situations, the cunning can find ways to serve their interests.

3. **Pitfalls of Naivety**: The Ass's joy at the prospect of a "royal alliance" leads to its downfall. This underscores the importance of skepticism, particularly when a proposition appears too good to be true, and highlights the risks of naivety.

4. **Subtle Details and Added Complexity**: The fable subtly underscores power dynamics. The Fox, though clever, doesn't directly confront the Lion due to the latter's superior strength. Instead, it uses its wit to manipulate the situation, pointing to the value of intellectual over physical strength in certain scenarios.

5. **Non-Obvious Lesson - Self-Preservation**: The Fox uses wit not just to escape punishment but to satisfy its hunger as well. Thus, the story underlines the use of intellect for self-preservation and achieving one's goals.

6. **Moral Complexity**: While the fable praises wit, it also brings to light a moral complexity as the Fox's cleverness is essentially applied in a dishonest context. This aspect could provoke reflections on the ethical boundaries of wit and cunning.

### Additional Interpretations and Insights:

1. **Abuse of Trust**: The Lion and the Fox lure the Ass into a trap by proposing an alliance. This underlines the importance of discerning the genuineness of offers and the potential for abuse of trust, especially when dealing with those who have ulterior motives.

2. **Adaptability**: The Fox, despite being lower in the hierarchy, is able to adapt to the situation. Its clever response to the Lion's accusation demonstrates the importance of being able to think on one's feet and adapt to unexpected circumstances.

In sum, "The Ass’s Brains" offers a rich array of insights, from the merits of quick thinking to the importance of caution when dealing with flattering proposals, the advantage of seizing opportunities when they present themselves, and the ethical considerations surrounding the use of wit and cunning.
