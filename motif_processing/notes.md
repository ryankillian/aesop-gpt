### Content Enhancement with General Insights

**Scenario:**
We aim to enrich a collection of fables in markdown format by automatically injecting general "insights" based on the specific motifs present in each fable.

**Background:**
The `.csv` file used in this process is a result of comprehensive data analysis conducted in a separate repository. This file acts as a mapping between specific motifs and the more general insights derived from those motifs.

**Setup:**

1. **Virtual Environment Setup:**
   Before executing any Python scripts, it's a good practice to set up a virtual environment. This ensures that the dependencies do not interfere with other projects or system-wide packages.

   - Navigate to the directory where you'll be running the scripts.
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On macOS and Linux:
       ```
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
   - Once activated, install any required packages using `pip`. For our case, you might need:
     ```
     pip install pandas
     ```

2. **Preparation:**
   - Ensure all fables in markdown format are placed within a designated directory.
   - The `.csv` mapping file should be readily available, having been generated from prior analysis.

**Process:**

1. **Script Execution:**

   - Run the first script, which processes the `.csv` mapping to prepare a dictionary for fast look-up between motifs and insights.
   - Execute the second script, which goes through each markdown file (fable) in the directory:
     - Extracts specific motifs from the fable's front matter.
     - Maps these motifs to general insights using the dictionary.
     - Injects these insights back into the fable's front matter without altering the original structure or content of the fable.

2. **Outcome:**
   - Every markdown file in the directory will now have an enhanced front matter containing the general "insights" corresponding to its motifs.
   - The main content of each markdown file remains unchanged, ensuring the integrity of the original fables.

**Note:**
This process provides a seamless way to augment the fables with insights, bridging the detailed analysis work from one repository with the content presentation in another.

**Clean Up:**

Once you've executed the scripts and are satisfied with the results, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply running:

```
deactivate
```

**TO DO:**

After all the analysis...

Update the sveltekit code to include insights!!

**Tip of the iceberg**

Clustering fine-grained motifs into general themes is a common task in text analytics, and there are several methods to approach it beyond KMeans. Here are a few options:

1. **Hierarchical Clustering**:

   - Instead of partitioning the data into non-overlapping clusters directly, hierarchical clustering works by grouping data over a series of steps, creating a tree of clusters.
   - This approach allows you to visualize the data's structure and decide on the number of clusters by cutting the tree at a certain level.
   - Visualization tools like dendrograms can be used to help determine where to cut the tree.

2. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**:

   - DBSCAN groups together data points that are close to one another based on a distance measure and a minimum number of points.
   - Unlike KMeans, DBSCAN doesn't require specifying the number of clusters a priori. Instead, it will find arbitrary shaped clusters and can identify noise (outliers).

3. **Topic Modeling (e.g., LDA: Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**:

   - While not a clustering technique in the traditional sense, topic modeling can be used to discover the underlying topics in a collection of texts.
   - LDA assumes each document is a mixture of topics, and a topic is a mixture of words. By running LDA, you can identify what those topics are.
   - After obtaining topics, each document (in your case, motifs) can be represented by its topic distribution, allowing for further clustering or classification.

4. **Agglomerative Clustering**:

   - Similar to hierarchical but tends to be more scalable. It starts with each data point as its own cluster and then merges the closest pairs of clusters step by step until only one cluster remains.

5. **Spectral Clustering**:

   - Uses the eigenvalues of the similarity matrix to reduce the dimensionality of the data before clustering in a lower-dimensional space. This can sometimes identify complex cluster structures.

6. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**:

   - Assumes that data is generated from several Gaussian distributions. It tries to learn these distributions and assign clusters based on which Gaussian distribution the data points are most likely to come from.

7. **T-SNE followed by Clustering**:

   - T-SNE is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be useful for visualizing high-dimensional data. Once data is projected into a 2D or 3D space using T-SNE, traditional clustering methods like KMeans can be applied to cluster data in this reduced space.

8. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**:
   - Autoencoders: Neural networks that aim to copy their inputs to their outputs. They compress the input into a dense intermediate representation from which the output is decoded. The dense representations can then be clustered.
   - Embedding Layers: Use pre-trained models like Word2Vec or BERT to convert motifs into embeddings, then cluster the embeddings using traditional methods.

When selecting a method, it's important to consider the size and nature of your data, as well as the kind of relationships and structures you believe exist within it. Often, it's beneficial to try multiple methods and compare the results to see which one aligns best with your objectives and domain knowledge.

Given the nature of the data (700 short motifs consisting of one to three words), the challenges are slightly different than those faced with longer texts. The sparsity of the data and its succinctness make it challenging to extract meaningful semantic relationships using some of the more advanced techniques.

** Possible future analysis **:

1. **Embeddings + Traditional Clustering**:

   - **Word Embeddings**: Use pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText to convert motifs into vector representations. These embeddings capture semantic meanings and are trained on massive corpora, allowing them to understand the relationships between words even if they are not explicitly present in your dataset.
   - Once you have the embeddings for your motifs, you can use traditional clustering techniques like **KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering**, or **DBSCAN** to group them.

2. **Topic Modeling (LDA)**:

   - Even though the motifs are short, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) might still be worth trying. It can help identify latent topics within the data. The results can be intuitive and easy to interpret, especially when dealing with textual data.

3. **Hierarchical Clustering**:

   - Given the relatively small size of the dataset (700 motifs), hierarchical clustering can be a good choice. It would allow you to visualize the data structure using dendrograms and decide on the number of clusters that make sense semantically.

4. **T-SNE Visualization**:

   - Even if you don't use T-SNE for clustering directly, it's a valuable tool for visualization. After converting the motifs to embeddings, you can use T-SNE to reduce their dimensionality for visualization. This step can give you insights into potential clusters and the relationships between motifs.

5. **DBSCAN**:
   - One advantage of DBSCAN is that it doesn't require specifying the number of clusters upfront and can identify noise. Given the concise nature of the motifs, there might be some that don't neatly fit into any cluster, and DBSCAN can identify them as outliers.

Considering the nature of the data, I would start with the **Embeddings + Traditional Clustering** approach. The use of embeddings allows you to capture semantic information from the motifs, and traditional clustering methods can then group them based on this semantic information.
